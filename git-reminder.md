## [Commit guidelines](#guidelines)

This repo uses the "Allowed types" as a one-liner version of the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#allowed-type). This results in commit messages which by default includes context of the commit. 

### [Allowed types](#allowed-types)

* feat (feature)

* fix (bug fix)

* docs (documentation)

* style (formatting, missing semi colons, â€¦)

* refactor

* test (when adding missing tests)

* chore (maintain)
